A simple data visualization module for practice. I am implementing sample module right now mentioned here,

http://newcoder.io/Intro-DataViz/


https://github.com/econchick/new-coder.git


What did I learn: (from the same source):

Understand how to:

run a Python file from the command line


import a Python file

take a raw file and parse its data with Python’s data structures

make a simple graph

produce a Google Maps-readable file

What else you will be exposed to:

Importing Python’s standard library as well as your own module

Installing and importing third party packages

Licensing & copyrights when using third-party packages

File Input/Output

Counter data structure from the collections module

Global variables, docstrings, list comprehensions

Python’s interactive shell in the terminal

Iterators versus Generators



I plan to enhance this project further
